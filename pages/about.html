                            Sometime in the 18th/19th century, Francesco Codoni arrived in Scotland. He was a circus performer. We don't have an image of him
                            so we used an image of Lalo Codona, a descendant of him. Francescos descendants continued performing in Scotland and other places
                            throughout the world. And after well over a 100 years, the family founded the Codona's amusement park in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1970.
